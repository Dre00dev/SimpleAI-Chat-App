- I found that chatgpt by default is not the best but when given a great prompt it is useful.
- Therefore I made a chatgpt app that has prompts that are from the Awesome ChatGPT prompts github.
- I created dedicated buttons to be able to use them. This way your answers will be clearer.

If you want to use or build upon this idea just add your OpenAI Secret key and play around with the code :)
